# Changesets

We use **Changesets** for automated versioning + changelog + publishing.

## Daily workflow

- For any user-facing change, add a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

- Commit the generated file in `.changeset/`.

## Release workflow (CI/CD)

- Merging PRs with changesets into `main` will cause CI to open/update a **Version Packages** PR.
- Merging the **Version Packages** PR will:
  - bump `package.json` version
  - update `CHANGELOG.md`
  - publish to npm
  - create a `vX.Y.Z` git tag + GitHub Release

# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
